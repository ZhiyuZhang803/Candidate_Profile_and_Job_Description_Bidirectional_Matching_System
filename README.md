# Candidate_Profile_and_Job_Description_Bidirectional_Matching_System
- This repo contains all files needed for constructing NLP based bidirectional matching system between candidate profile and job description and improve the efficiency as well as the accuracy in matching process.
- This system was first constructed during summer 2022 internship but is improved and will improve continuously.
- If you have any question or just show strong interest towards our project, please do not hesitate to contact the Author via zhiyuzha@usc.edu.

## Main Purpose and Brief Introduction:
Matching system is one of the most popular artificial intelligence systems for companies in different industries across the world. As a world-leading recruiting company, we also wants to introduce this kind of system to fill the gap and improve the experience of clients. We aim to construct a bidirectional matching system between recruiter and potential candidates with machine learning techniques (especially advanced NLP techniques), improving the efficiency of recruitment activity and grabbing market share of our start-up.

## Basic Workflow and Algorithms:
- Core Algorithms:
In order to compare the similarity of two text-based content (candidate profile and job description), we need to clean the original dataset (seperate words and remove useless words), vectorize core features (transfor from text to numerical data) and project the vector to pre-defined recruiting matrix (recruiting maxtrix that contains all features we need to evaluate). Finally, calculate cosine similarity between features and select candidate with high number.
